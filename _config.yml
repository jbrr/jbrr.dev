  Ever found yourself without enough Jeffs around?
  Of course you have, we've all been there. Be Jeffless no more!
  Have I got a Jeff for you!

  I'm a software engineer living in Denver, Colorado with my fianc√©e and our adorable corgi, [Uzi](/images/uzi.jpg). They're just the absolute best.
  I'm a full stack developer ready to learn whatever stack is thrown at me. I'm strongest in <mark>Ruby</mark>, <mark>Ruby on Rails</mark>, and <mark>Python</mark>.
  As far as the frontend is concerned, I've worked with <mark>JQuery</mark>, <mark>React</mark>, and <mark>Vue.js</mark>.
  From a database perspective, I'm most comfortable with <mark>PostgreSQL</mark>, but have worked with <mark>DynamoDB</mark> in the past, and I have extensive
  experience with many different services in <mark>AWS</mark>.

  I'm not just a software engineer! I also have extensive experience with:
   - Rock n roll
   - Dive bars
   - Camping
   - Photography (Alright, extensive experience might be a bit much, but I like piddling around with my camera in the mountains!)
