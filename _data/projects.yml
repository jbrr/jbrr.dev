    This is a side project I've been working on lately to better learn <mark>React</mark>, as well as <mark>Flask</mark>.
    The project ingests data from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), and maps out mosquitos density by genus across the US for now.
    The server is a Python/Flask/PostgreSQL/PostGIS stack. The client uses a React/Leaflet.js stack.

    This is a very old project, but one that I'm still proud of. A classmate and I built an <mark>HTML5 canvas</mark> version of the classic
    Windows game Ski Free. I have fond memories of this project, especially brushing up on trigonometry to determine the path the Yeti
    should take to attack the skier.
