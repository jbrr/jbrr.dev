Hi, I'm Jeff, and you need more Jeff's in your life. Currently living in Denver, Colo. with my lovely wife and working as a senior software engineer at [Tackle](https://tackle.io). I like thinking about data, effective teams, mental health, and empathy. When I was younger, I journaled every day, and I'd like to get back into the habit. So here I am, writing a blog that nobody will ever read!
