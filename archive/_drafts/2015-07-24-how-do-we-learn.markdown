I'm halfway through the first module here at Turing School, and I thought that
I should reflect on my time so far, and if it has been well spent. After three
weeks of getting drunk all day every day on Ruby, I would recommend not merely
getting buzzed on Ruby, but getting absolutely wrecked.

Let me explain. I've tried to learn programming before through books and online
tutorials. I would finish something, feel proud of myself, and then go do something
else, and then feel lost when I tried to go back to it. Not everybody has that
problem, some people have different learning styles, and I have plenty of friends
who are self taught and now have careers in programming. For me, though, momentum
is everything. I would drink too much Python at once, and then take a day off to
shake off the hangover, but all of a sudden my tolerance was gone. And that's
why Turing School is different, and that's why, so far, it's working for me.

The first week, it was all basics. We spent a day doing exercises just manipulating
arrays. We spent a day doing tedious work with enumerables. The second week, we
were assigned a project converting markdown to html. I struggled, a lot, and I
somehow got it done, and I was proud. If I were on my own, I may have quit when
got frustrated, or even if I had finished it, I would have taken a break
afterwards to "reward myself", or something. That was not the
case at Turing. "You guys did alright, for your first project," they said, "now
build a linked list in Ruby." Three days later, that was due, and now onto a
code cracking program appropriately called *Enigma*.
