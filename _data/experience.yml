    After being a full time contractor for about 9 months, I accepted a full time position at Tendril.
    I was initially on the Customer Engineering team, where we handled customer feature requests and bug reports.
    Along with the help of some great coworkers, this role taught me how to get ramped up quickly on new codebases and technologies.
    I learned here a little bit about <mark>Java</mark>, <mark>Scala</mark>, <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>Apache Mesos/Marathon</mark>,
    and continued strengthening my skills around <mark>Ruby</mark> and <mark>Rails</mark>.
    Around this time Tendril started transitioning all services to <mark>AWS</mark>,
    so I started picking that up as well.
    I also started taking responsibility for configuring SSO for our <mark>Rails</mark> application using <mark>SAML</mark>.

    After some internal shuffling, I was put on a new team that worked on a customer facing application
    that allows users to discover how their home uses energy, and offered tips on saving energy (demo site available upon request).
    This application was built with <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>Vue.js</mark>, <mark>SAML</mark> (via <mark>Auth0</mark>),
    <mark>AWS DynamoDB</mark>, <mark>AWS Lambda</mark>, and <mark>AWS API Gateway</mark>.

    We brought that application up to speed, and our small team was moved over to onboarding new clients.
    This involves touching all aspects of our services, starting from ingesting utility data into our system,
    all the way to designing templates for mass paper mailers using <mark>React</mark>.
    I've become comfortable with <mark>Event Driven Architecture</mark> on this team, as well as many aspects of <mark>ETL</mark>.
    Our first priority was standardizing the way we ingest data into our platform. I had some incredibly sharp coworkers,
    and while I can't take credit for being the principle architect of the new platform,
    I participated in design sessions and many spikes to figure out the best way to do it.
    We ended up with a new <mark>ETL</mark> pipeline built using many <mark>AWS</mark> services,
    including <mark>Glue</mark>, <mark>Lambda</mark>, <mark>Batch</mark>, and <mark>ECS</mark>.
    In this role, I've become much more comfortable with <mark>Python</mark> and <mark>SQL</mark>.

  job_title: Contract Junior Software Engineer
  dates: June 2016 - April 2017
  description: |
    I was hired on a 3-week contract as a junior developer to help internationalize a <mark>Rails</mark> application for an upcoming launch in Italy.
    It runs on a <mark>PostgreSQL</mark> database with a <mark>JQuery</mark> and <mark>Highcharts</mark> frontend. It's a legacy application at this point,
    running on Ruby 1.9.3 and Rails 3, which presented its own challenges.
    After winning a hot dog eating contest or something, they decided to extend that contract, and I ended up working on a team dedicated to that Rails application.
    This being my first full time position out of Turing, I was just constantly learning about everything from looking through Rails source code to debug an issue,
    to professional workflow, agile development, and git. Things were so simple then, just us and a Rails app.

    At MotoTV, I worked as a part-time contractor doing some miscellaneous <mark>JavaScript</mark> and <mark>PHP/Laravel</mark> work on an application
    that displayed digital billboards/menus in extreme sports shops. Some of this involved researching APIs for snow reports and surf conditions.
    I ended up not staying long after being offered a full time contract. While I was extremely grateful for the opportunity, the company was very
    small, and it was just me and one other senior engineer, who was remote. It wasn't ideal conditions for a junior developer, especially when it involved
    picking up a new language.

  job_title: Student Support Fellow
  dates: February 2016 - March 2016
  description: |
    I was extremely honored when I was offered a position working part-time at Turing after I graduated. This was a new role, and from what I understand,
    it still exists now. The staff offers one graduating student per cohort this fellowship, which involves being a in house help desk for students who are struggling with some concepts,
    or just want to ask a quick question, or want to talk about the job hunt, or even just the stresses of being at Turing. The fellowship lasted one module (or six weeks).
