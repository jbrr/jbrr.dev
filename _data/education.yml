    Turing is an all out blitz of learning <mark>Ruby</mark>, <mark>Rails</mark>, and <mark>JavaScript</mark>, as well as more universal concepts and technologies
    like <mark>git</mark>, <mark>bash</mark>, and <mark>test driven development</mark>. It's a 7-month program, consisting of 4 modules
    (Ruby, web servers/introduction to Rails, expertise in Rails, and JavaScript). It wasn't at all unusual to spend 50 to 60 hours a week working on
    projects and studying concepts just to keep up with the torrent of information that was thrown at us.

    Bootcamps in general have a mixed reputation, but Turing is consistently regarded as one of the best, and deciding to go is maybe the best decision I've ever made.
    It was founded by Jeff Casimir after his work at Hungry Academy, and after splitting with gSchool (now Galvanize) regarding
    a disagreement about profit model. So he founded Turing as a non-profit organization, and insisted that graduation and placement rates were audited by a third party.
    It's 5 years old now, and still going strong.
