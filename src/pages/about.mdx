## About Me

I'm Jeff Ruane, Jeff extraordinaire. Here are some arbitrary facts about me. I'm a software/data engineer living in Denver, CO. I try very hard to make sure people feel included and respected when I'm in a position to do so. I don't punch down, and I have very little tolerance for those who do. I like to take photos. I'm not very good, but I have fun doing it. My wife and I fell in love in Glacier National Park. I just bought a banjo, I'm still struggling with the technique. I have a Newfoundland named Bumble.

## About This Site

The source code is on [Github](https://github.com/jbrr/jbrr.dev). [Astro](https://astro.build) is behind the scenes, and I'm constantly messing with it because _I just don't get these newfangled web frameworks_. I use [Netlify](https://netlify.com) to build and deploy it. Please feel free if you have suggestions, I'm just trying desperately to stay even _slightly_ aware of frontend development. I have no idea what I'm doing.

### Analytics

I use [Plausible](https://plausible.io) to collect visitor metrics. Plausible is [GDPR, CCPA and cookie law compliant](https://plausible.io/data-policy), and I use it because I respect your privacy and I'd rather pay for analytics than put one more Google Analytics cookie into the world.
