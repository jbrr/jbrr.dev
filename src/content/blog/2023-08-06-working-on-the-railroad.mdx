In 2012, after moving back into my parents' house in my mid 20s and lacking any real prospects, I took a job in St. Paul, MN working as a freight conductor on Union Pacific trains. Recently, the great David Gilbert asked about the experience, and this is way too much for a tweet, so I thought I'd sprawl and just make a blog post about it.

## What kind of work did I do?

I could go into a _ton_ of detail here that I don't think most people would care about. The short version is that I was mostly a road conductor, and occasionally a yard conductor. The old adage is that the engineer owns the engine and the conductor owns the train. Most of my work was centered around getting cars from point A to point B. This could vary _greatly_ in complexity.

For example, one regular job in my region was a Norfolk Southern intermodal express train that Union Pacific carried outside the NS service area. This train arrived at the terminal fully assembled, it had priority above all other freight trains, and no cars were dropped off at the destination terminal. So as a conductor, my only job was to talk to the dispatcher every few hours and get new track warrants as ours expired.

However, manifest trains could involve picking up cars off of multiple tracks in the correct order at the origin terminal, which could take hours depending on the other active jobs and trains in the yard and where the cars were in the yard. If by some miracle you make it to the destination before hitting the 12-hour mark (the maximum amount of time a train crew can work per the FRA), then those cars would have to be dropped off in a particular order on particular tracks at the destination terminal.

The average day consisted of a few hours of actual work to start off with followed by 6 - 8 hours of tedium, and finally a few hours of sleep-deprived work at the destination. It was also common to get stuck waiting for another job or a dispatcher or something for literally 12-hours, the maximum amount of time train crews are allowed to work, and we'd just clock out and go home. It was hard to predict what would happen from one day to the next.

## Best moments

There was a specific job near Eau Claire, WI that involved shoving backwards several miles from a lumberyard to the terminal. Because we were going backwards, I had to get on the back of the train and tell the engineer how much farther they're clear to keep moving (e.g. "Job 80, you're clear for another 80 car lengths"). Anyway, there was a huge bridge over the Chippewa River between the lumberyard and the terminal, and holy shit, the rush of holding onto a ladder on the side of a boxcar while several hundred feet above a raging river was _incredible_. I couldn't help but howling with joy at the sheer rush of it. It was one of the most intense life-affirming moments I've ever experienced.

There were a lot of peaceful moments that I remember fondly. Being stuck at a siding in the middle of rural Wisconsin at 2 AM and smoking a cigarette and looking at the Milky Way. Being stationed in Superior, WI / Duluth, MN and watching the dawn over a frozen Lake Superior. Rattling along stick rail through the fall Midwestern foliage.

I met some characters too. There was an old head engineer named Carl who saved someone's life once. He was rolling along the rail and saw someone sitting in the middle of the tracks, I'm not sure if that person was there because of addiction issues or a mental health crisis, but regardless, Carl realized that he wouldn't be able to stop the train in time, so he jumped out of his seat and ran onto the stairs on the front of the engine and reached out and grabbed the person and hoisted them up onto the train, all while the train was in motion! Carl was skinny and gruff, and there was always the odd chance that he'd start yelling at me for whatever reason, but he had a good heart in there.

There was a guy in my conductor class named Ryan, and he joined up after being a private contractor Iraq and Afghanistan. He told me that he liked the job because it let him get away from his family and spend half his time in hotels. He also told me that he missed killing Muslims. He was not a good guy, but the experience of meeting someone so wildly different than anybody I'd ever met before was interesting at least.

I also met a conductor named Jack who had been an Army intelligence officer before joining up with UP. He _loved_ trains, a foamer through and through. He was the only person I met on the railroad who actually wore an old-timey conductor hat. He was a very nice, very thoughtful guy. He was always so calm, nothing ever fazed him, so I really liked working with him when I was new and absolutely terrified.

## Worst moments

There were many dark moments. Being on call 24/7/365 was brutal. Most of the trains were at night, so I'd sleep all day. It was impossible to make friends in a city where I knew nobody. Seniority in each graduating conductor class was determined randomly, essentially, and I drew the lowest seniority out of the whole class. This meant that I couldn't hold a job anywhere in the region, so they just kept me in training for almost a year while they waited for a job to open up. That was fine, except that it meant I moved all over the region to train, so I spent 2 months in a Super 8 in Adams, WI, another month in a Best Western in Superior, &c. It was the loneliest I've ever been.

I was laid off a few days before Christmas. On the railroad, "laid off" is similar to being furloughed. I decided to head home and spend Christmas with my family. I got home, soaked up some warmth and love, and went out drinking with a friend that night. I was woken up, still drunk, at 7 AM by my union rep calling me to tell me that I was back on the board, and I was scheduled to be on the third train out of Adams. I drove, first tipsy then hungover, for 18 hours straight, and checked into the Super 8. I laid down and 20 minutes later my phone rang, and I had to be at work in 90 minutes. Fucking miserable.

There were two things that happened that made me finally say "fuck this" and quit. First, conductors need a certain number of miles traveled to qualify for vacation time, and at the end of the year I came up like 20 miles short. So, I was looking at 2 years on the job without a dependable single day off. Second, a vacancy finally opened up for me, and it just happened to be the only job in the entire region that I _hadn't_ been trained on. It was also in Eau Claire, so I'd have to move from St. Paul. So I quit, and I spent the next few months chewing through my savings at a bar growing more and more depressed before finally moving back home to Denver.

## What surprised you about the job?

A lot of things surprised me. First, just how dangerous it is. While I was in conductor school, someone in our service unit in a yard in Iowa got pinched between the knuckles of two cars. Our instructor told us that when that happens, you don't die until the separate the cars. They bring you a phone so you could call your loved ones, and then you tell them that you're ready. I worked with quite a few people with missing limbs from one accident or another. Even with modern safety standards and FRA regulations, it's still an incredible dangerous job.

I was also surprised by just how strong the union was. We didn't work for the carrier. We worked in the union, and we just so happened to be on Union Pacific trains. If an injury happened in the field, they warned us over and over to never say a word to anybody from Union Pacific. We call the union and let them speak for us, always.
