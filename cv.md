Here's the skills I've developed and the work I've done so far, in a little bit more detail than a [resume]({{site.url}}/assets/resume.pdf).

### Skills
* Languages
  * Ruby (1.9.6 / 2.x)
  * JavaScript (ES5 / ES6 / CoffeeScript)
  * HTML / CSS
* Frameworks
  * Rails (Rails 3 / Rails 4)
  * Sinatra
  * jQuery
  * Node.js
  * Express (JavaScript)
  * CSS frameworks (MaterializeCSS, Bootstrap)
* Testing
  * Ruby / Rails (Minitest, RSpec, Capybara, Cucumber)
  * Javascript (Mocha, Chai, Karma, Jasmine, Protractor)
* Misc / Other
  * SQL (PostgreSQL, SQLite)
  * git
  * Jira
  * Remote terminal work (SSH / Capistrano)

### Experience
* **Tendril, Inc.** - Contract Ruby on Rails Developer (Boulder, CO; 06/2016 - present)
  * I was hired on at Tendril to internationalize their application for deployment in Italy and Canada. Along the way that has involved dealing with a legacy Rails application with a large amount of tech debt, which has actually been a fantastic learning experience.  
  The application is service oriented, so while Rails is the frontend and part of the backend, a large amount of the work is being done by services written in Java and Scala that we make API calls to. This has lead to frustrating experiences, because the services are more or less a black box, but it's also been valuable to learn how to work around the mysterious parts.  
  Git workflow is extremely valued on this team, and we strive to keep commits atomic, and allow commits to serve as documentation. Agile methodologies are taken very seriously; we're encouraged to not work on anything without a story. I've also gotten good experience using Capistrano to deploy the application to remote non-production servers to allow the translators access to view and test the application.  
  Tendril has been an amazing experience so far, all the way from management who really seem to understand how engineers work, to other engineers on my team, who are all far more experienced than I am, and who I'm eagerly learning as much as I can from.
* **MotoTV Networks** - Contract JavaScript Developer (Denver, CO; 2016/03 - 2016/06)
  * MotoTV does digital signage for "extreme sports" shops, like ski shops, surf shops, and motorcycle shops. Their main application was a large Laravel / PHP project, which I worked on to some extent, but I spent most of my time working on JavaScript widgets that would be displayed on a digital signage screen. For example, I wrote a news ticker that the business owner could program to display whatever they want, or a snow report widget for a ski shop. The people I worked with were great, and it was a great experience trying to figure out a new language without having my hand held (on those occasions when I would be asked to work with PHP). I left because I wanted more hours, and the next contract that came along was a full time contract, and I didn't have time for both.
* **Turing School of Software and Design** - Student Support Fellowship (Denver, CO; 2016/02- 2016/03)
  * After graduating from Turing, I was offered a short term contract to work as a tutor, and spend my days pairing with students one on one. I had a great time, and I learned an awful lot. Teaching is a great way to learn, so it was a valuable experience.
