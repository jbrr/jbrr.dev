There are a lot of technical-ish topics I've been meaning to write about. I've been meaning to write about scaling engineering teams and why it often goes poorly. I want to write about an excellent book on relational database performance that I picked up. But it's December 31; it's the last day of this horrible, no good, very rotten year. So instead, I'm going to reflect on that, and what I learned.

I'm grateful that this year is over. Even if it is an arbitrary marker, it feels like an accomplishment to be working again in a position that I'm thrilled about with some wonderful folks. That said, it's been a tough way to end the year here in Colorado. [At least 1,000 homes burned down yesterday](https://coloradosun.com/2021/12/31/marshall-fire-boulder-county/), cementing the fact that we no longer have a fire "season". On Monday, [5 people were killed](https://coloradosun.com/2021/12/29/lyndon-james-mcleod-books/) in a murder spree that spanned across Denver. The details coming out after the fact are even darker than I could've imagined. It's reminding us all that angry, radicalized white men continue to be a persistent threat, and provides us the worst possible bookend to January 6.

## Lesson 1: I'm not as strong as I thought I was

I have a general distaste for hubris. It frustrates me so much in other people that I tend to overcorrect, often to my own detriment. That said, I always knew I could take care of myself. I'm not easily overwhelmed, it's not easy to get a rise out of me. Whatever bullshit comes my way, I've always been confident that I'll still be standing afterwards. I came up in [the city of big shoulders](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/12840/chicago) after all.

It turns out, in all humility, I can now say I was wrong about that. I have my limits, and I'm not able to catch my fall when I reach that point. I saw it coming, too. For months, I thought to myself "I don't know how much longer I can go on like this," and would immediately realize that I don't have a choice. There was no alternative. I sought help. I started seeing a therapist, I met with my psychiatrist more frequently. I started antidepressants, I went to support groups, I didn't know what else I could've done. Things were out of my control. All I felt for weeks on end were helplessness and desperation and there was no end in sight. Those were the most difficult of my life so far.

Over time, I could feel my emotions getting blunted. Shit still sucked, but it just didn't get me quite as much as it had been. That's the amazing thing about humans, we adjust to our situations remarkably well, at least in the short term. The problem is that those short term coping mechanisms are just a loan from the brain, and the brain charges an unreasonable interest rate. Before I knew it, I was barely registering anything at all, and I was content enough sleeping through the daily morning standup. After I didn't show up to work for 2 weeks or so, I lost my job, naturally. I knew I should've been upset about that, but it just seemed _fine_.

What's the lesson here? For the past few months, since the situation that started me down this road has started to improve, I didn't think there was one. I've been going to great lengths to avoid thinking about it. Anything I can put in front of my face to keep the horror tucked in the back of my mind will do. But now, sitting here reflecting on the year after everything that happened, I don't think I've been doing myself any favors. There _has_ to be something of value there, some personal growth that came out of it. I can't let go of it until _something's_ there. So, that brings me to:

## Lesson 2: None of us have any control

When you see someone you love suffering, you try to help. Most of the time that works out pretty well. Your spouse having a bad day, so you listen to them, maybe you make them their favorite meal, and everyone goes to bed a little happier than they otherwise would have. But what do you do if you can't console them? They're furious that Greg in accounting told everyone that they're the reason the project is behind, and try as you might, you just can't console them. At some point, you just have to throw your arms up and give up. We relinquish control _all the time_, it's just usually in pretty low risk situations.

However, when the stakes are higher, that becomes more difficult. Imagine if instead of being annoyed with a coworker, your spouse is experiencing psychosis. What if they're having conversations with people that aren't there, and they think you're not actually you but an impostor who's trying to hurt them? What if the days turn into weeks, and the weeks turn into months and things continue to deteriorate? And the paramedics can't help because your spouse can hold it together _just enough_ when they're around? And the social worker who said that he'll stop by every few days just doesn't? You call him a few times, but he never returns your calls. So apparently you're the only one that even cares enough to even try to help. And you know it's not fair to yourself, but they'd be living on the streets at this point had you not been around to help out.

I think you ought to let go and accept that you can't help, just like you let go when they were annoyed with a coworker. I have no idea what the practical application of that looks like. I _do_ know that the more I tried to help and take control of the situation, the more exhausted and soul-crushingly hopeless I was. I think I would've been better served to accept that I was powerless earlier on, and just been around to make sure nobody gets hurt.

This is a lesson a lot of us have learned over the past two years. I think a lot of people felt the pain of being suddenly powerless over what's happening to them. I have a strong hunch this is part of what led to the rise of Qanon, for example. But we weren't really ever in control, and it saves a lot of anguish to internalize it. It may not be the feeling of the loss of control that's difficult, but the desperate thrashing to retake it.

## Lesson 3: Recognizing early signs of acute mental illness is extraordinarily important

There were so many signs early on that she was not well, and was having trouble controlling intrusive thoughts. I didn't know what I was looking for, or even that I should be looking for it. I think about how much pain could've been spared if I had, though. I will never again be the person who makes excuses for unusual behavior. For example, this is not something I would've done a year ago.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Please look out for each other. Please recognize the signs of mental illness, people don&#39;t do that if things are going well in their life.</p>&mdash; Jeff Ruane (@jefbrr) <a href="https://twitter.com/jefbrr/status/1473137308517896194?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 21, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

A year ago, I would've just thought to myself "oh, that guys probably just having a bad day and wants to be alone".

If anybody reads this, please go over some of [the general early symptoms of mental illness](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mental-illness/symptoms-causes/syc-20374968). I promise you, it's so much better to do something and be wrong than the other way around. Everyone's struggling right now, we all have to do what we can to take care of each other.

Here's to hoping 2022 goes a little smoother. Happy new year, folks.
